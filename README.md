> A modern reservations system for the modern restaurant.

A restaurant host is tasked with quite a bit of management: reservations tracking and table management make up their core responsibilities, requiring a solid overview of their restaurant's demands and available resources. ***Table-It!*** is designed to make their lives easier.

With ***Table-It!***, a host is given access to a high-level dashboard in which they can immediately see and manage the day's current reservations and the restaurant's set of tables. The host is given the tools to:
* Browse reservations by date or search by phone number
* See the status and capacity of the restaruant's tables
* Log new tables and reservations
* Edit existing tables and reservations
* Seat reservations at a table
* Free tables when their associated guests leave the restaurant

In all, ***Table-It*** empowers hosts to efficiently manage their restaurant's resources, easing their burden and ensuring a smooth customer experience from the time the customer calls their reservation in to the time they leave the establishment.
